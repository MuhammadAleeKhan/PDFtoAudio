# PDF to Audio
A python script that automatically converts any pdf into an audio and reads it to you.

## What does it do?
It performs the following processes:
1. Reads the PDF provided
2. Uses the text extracted from the PDF and reads it to you

## How to use?
1. The best way to use my script is to firstly clone the git repo where you want to.
2. Select PDF to convert
3. Edit the first number to skip the starting pages of the book, (changing the 1 to any other page number)
for i in range(1,pages):
    page.append(i)

## What happens behind the scene?
1. The function "convert_pdf_to_txt" parses the pdf and saves the text 
2. Using pyttsx3, the text is fed to the function say() which produces an audio of the whole text
